<p>Jasmine,</p>

<p>If you’re reading this, then I’m probably already on the plane or just about to leave. I’ve spent the last few days writing everything I’ve been feeling—about us, about the moments we’ve shared, and how much you mean to me. I’ve loved you through every quiet moment, every laugh, every drive, and every time you reached for my hand.</p>

<p>I don’t know exactly how the next three months will feel, but I do know one thing for sure: my heart’s still with you. It’s always been with you. You’ve made me feel more whole than I thought was possible, and I’m so thankful for every second we’ve had together.</p>

<p>No matter how far I go, I’ll always be close. I’ll always be thinking of you.</p>

<p>And just like the song says…<br>
“I’m here for you still…”<br>
“Who’s to say that our love ain’t real?”</p>

<p>I love you. Always.<br>
—Yevin ❤️

        <div class="diaryPage" style="display:block;">Day 1 – May 26, 2025

Only six days left until I leave for California for my 12-week internship. I leave on Sunday, and the countdown is starting to feel real. I know it won’t fully sink in until I’m packing the night before or sitting on that plane. I’m trying to spend as much time as I can with Jasmine before I go. I know I’ll miss my family, but most of all, I’ll miss her.

Being with Jasmine again has made my life feel complete. Since we’ve been back together, everything’s felt better. She’s been my peace, my joy, and my constant. I don’t know what I’d do without her.

Today was one of those perfect days. We started out at Tysons, where Jasmine wanted to shop for makeup. I still don’t understand the difference between any of it, but I know she’s been wanting to switch to a lighter makeup look. She says it looks better on her than darker makeup. I still don’t get it, but I trust her. Today, she tried on a lighter look, and she looked gorgeous. No, stunning. She was glowing.

And it wasn’t just her look—her energy today was amazing. She seemed so happy, and I could feel it radiating off her. Every time she held my hand or reached for it, I felt complete. I don’t even know how to describe it. She just makes me feel whole.

We couldn’t find what she needed at first, so I suggested we go to Mosaic after to check out other stores. At Tysons, I also bought her a pair of earrings from another store. She looked so beautiful in them. She kept telling me I didn’t need to buy them, but once I did, she thanked me over and over again. That’s just who she is—always grateful, always kind.

And then she surprised me. She said she wanted to buy me an Apple Pencil. I told her she didn’t have to, that I’d get it myself eventually, but she insisted. That’s Jasmine. Always doing thoughtful things, always giving back.

We got Heytea. Passionfruit for me, Mango Boom for her. While we waited for our drinks, we stopped by a few shops: Gamestop, Pink, Victoria’s Secret, Aerie. Then we drove a Tesla Model S for fun, and we both loved it. I’m seriously thinking of getting one when I come back from California.

After that, we headed to Mosaic. Target didn’t have any Pokémon cards, but we finally found the makeup she was looking for at Sephora there, and she was so happy. Then we stopped by Teado in Annandale and got onigiris, those little rice snacks from the store, and they were fire. We also hit up a K-beauty store and ended the night with dinner at Shilla. I got a spinach sandwich, and Jasmine loved it so much I gave her half. That’s us. We just share everything.

But then came the hardest part: driving her back home. It’s always the saddest part of the day. That’s when the day ends. That’s when I have to say goodbye and don’t get to be with her again until tomorrow. It’s always a little heavy, but knowing I’ll see her again soon makes it bearable.

Still, I know time’s running out. I don’t know how I’m going to handle leaving her. I keep telling myself, surely I won’t crash out, surely I won’t cry when I drop her off for the last time before I leave for three months. Hopefully her mom lets her come visit me in California in July, so we can watch fireworks together on the 4th and spend my birthday side by side. That would mean the world to me.

For now, I’ll take it one day at a time. That’s all I can do.

        <div class="diaryPage" style="display:none;">Day 2 – May 28, 2025
Today was light. We didn’t do that much, but it still felt amazing because I got to spend time with Jasmine.

We both had work this morning. She also had a math class. Work wasn’t too bad for either of us. She left early because she was bored, and I left around the same time to go pick her up. She had a meeting at 2:30 PM with someone from PwC. I made sure to time it so that by the time I got there, she’d be just finishing up. I really hope she did well. I know how much getting that internship or job means to her. I can see how badly she wants it, and I know she deserves it.

Afterward, we headed to Kpot for lunch. We got there about 20 to 30 minutes later, and I used a coupon so we could both do Korean BBQ and hotpot for only $20 each. When we sat down, our iPad wasn’t working, and the server had to spend a good 10 to 15 minutes trying to fix it. While we waited, Jasmine was cold, so I tried to keep her warm. Just having those little moments holding her, helping her feel comfortable made me feel close to her.

After lunch, she said she wanted something matcha, so we went to Kyo Matcha in Falls Church. She got a matcha drink with ice cream, and I got an ice cream cone for myself. It was chill and relaxed, but just being with her made everything feel better.

I was really tired after all that and started to get sleepy on the way back to her house, but I managed to make it. Dropping her off at the end of the day always hits a little hard. I know I’ll see her again tomorrow, but with only four days left before I leave for California, that feeling is starting to grow heavier.

She offered to take me to the airport for my flight even though she usually doesn’t drive on highways. I’d never let her do that, but it meant the world to me that she offered. I know she just wants to be there with me as long as she can.

We’re both trying not to think too much about the goodbye coming on Saturday. I’m planning to spend the entire day with her, just making the most of every second. It’s going to be hard, but for now, I’m just grateful we have tomorrow.

That’s it for today, we’ll see how tomorrow goes.

        <div class="diaryPage" style="display:none;">Day 3 – May 28, 2025
Today was T-minus 3 days until I basically leave. We were originally going to go to Georgetown, but because it was raining a lot, we decided to go to Tysons instead.

Jasmine had work today and I didn’t. She went in late because she was tired, and honestly, I slept a decent amount too since I had the day off. There was just something about the weather, probably the rain, that made both of us feel so tired.

Later on, Jasmine left work early to head home, but I still couldn’t go see her because my sister had the car. Jasmine went to a card store with Julia and said she’d be back home soon. While she was there, she bought me a card. I told her she didn’t have to get me anything, but she said it was too late, so I smiled.

Once my sister finally got home, I left to go see Jasmine, but I got stuck in the worst traffic ever. A 20 minute drive turned into almost 50. I was so over the traffic, but I knew it would be worth it because I was going to see her.

When I picked her up, she showed me the card she had gotten me. It was the cutest card ever. I didn’t expect it, and she really didn’t have to, but she said she wanted to because she knew I’d love it.

At Tysons, we first went to Sephora because she wanted to buy the right makeup. She was holding it and I just grabbed it from her and said I’d pay for it because I wanted to. She said I didn’t have to, but I insisted. We don’t have much time left before I leave, and I want to do as much as I can while we’re still together.

Then we went to Café Maiko and got some ice cream. After that, we went to GameStop to check for Pokémon cards (they didn’t have any).

Afterwards, we went to Urban Outfitters because Jasmine wanted to check for a bag. They didn’t have the one she liked. Then we walked around a bit more and stopped at Panda Express because she was hungry. After I got her food, we left since her mom wanted her home because someone was coming over. Before that though, she wanted to get a mouse for her laptop.

We stopped at Safeway to check for Pokémon cards in the vending machine, but it was empty. Then we went to Micro Center. She found a mouse she liked, and while we were in line, I did the same thing I did at Sephora I grabbed the mouse and paid for it. She always says she hates when I do that, but she knows I do it for her, and she appreciates it.

I also showed her the “limited edition” Micro Center soda I always get. She called me a bot. Something about it makes me feel special. It’s like her way of telling me she thinks I’m weird, but that’s why she loves me just for it.

Right as we left, Julia texted Jasmine that the power had gone out at home. Jasmine was a little upset, but she didn’t want to let it ruin the mood, so she kept it in. I tried to reassure her the best I could. I get it though if my power and WiFi went out for hours, I’d be upset too.

Driving her home was the saddest part, and what made it worse is that I might not even get to see her tomorrow. But I got to see her today, and that’s what matters.

After I dropped her off, I sat in the car for a few minutes and just thought about everything. I already missed her. It’s hard not to think about how little time we have left together before I leave. But I know I’ll see her again soon. I’m holding on to that. Even if it’s just for a few more days, I’m going to make every moment count.

        <div class="diaryPage" style="display:none;">Day 4 – May 29, 2025
Today was honestly kinda slow, but Jasmine made it feel less empty. I texted her in the morning just to make sure she was good reminding her to drive safe, let me know when she got to work, stuff like that. She forgot to text me at first, but I didn’t mind. She had class, and I get it. I just always wanna make sure she’s okay.

Her day sounded boring and slow, and she forgot her mouse at home 😭. I offered to pick her up from Tysons if she ended up going, but that whole thing kinda flopped. Kevin bailed, so there wasn’t really anything left for me to do today. I told her to use my card if she wanted something, and of course she refused at first, but I just wanted her to know I got her no matter what.

She had her interview today too. I could tell she was nervous as hell, but I kept telling her she’s got it. I know how hard she’s worked, and I know she did better than she thinks. Even when she felt like she blacked out, I still know she made a good impression.

Later on, she told me about all the chaos in the car fighting over boba, Pokémon cards, and people saying the craziest things 💀. It sounded so exhausting, and I felt bad she had to deal with all that. I kept offering to pick her up, help her out, whatever she needed. I just wanted her to feel like she wasn’t alone in it.

Now we’ve only got 2 days left together before I leave for California. I’m really hoping we can do something special with the time we’ve got left. Just small stuff that turns into big memories. I wanna make more of those little “meteorites” with her moments that feel like they stop time and hold onto them until we’re together again.

I’m gonna miss her so much.

        <div class="diaryPage" style="display:none;">Day 5 – May 30, 2025
Today felt a little heavier. Woke up with only two days left, and it’s been creeping into everything I do. Jasmine was at work and tired, and I could tell she felt bad about not being able to hang out. We were planning to meet, maybe around 5–6, but the weather and her mom not letting her leave because of a tornado warning kind of ruined it. I didn’t want her to feel bad so I ran her errands, picked up the matcha lemonade and Dubai chocolate from Trader Joe’s, and even helped her figure out her mouse situation from miles away like her tech support hero lol.

Even though we didn’t get to meet, I still felt close to her. We texted throughout, joked about Micro Center being the Sephora for tech, and she promised to wake up early tomorrow so we could have more time. I told her it wasn’t fun getting pho today because she wasn’t there. She said she missed me too.

There’s something about how she said, “I’m very excited to see you tomorrow” that hit me. We only have one full day left now. I’m really hoping we can do something special tomorrow just something small but meaningful. I want to make a memory that lasts, one of those meteorites we always talk about something we can both carry with us until she comes to California.

        <div class="diaryPage" style="display:none;">Day 6 – May 31, 2025
Today was the last day before I leave - May 31, 2025

I leave tomorrow at 5 a.m., so I only have about five hours left as I’m writing this. I left around 3 p.m. to go pick up Jasmine and got to her house around 3:30. From there, we headed to the Labubu store. But once we got there, we both noticed a line outside the shop. Jasmine didn’t want to wait, and it started raining, so we left and headed to Tysons instead.

At Tysons, our first stop was Sephora to get Jasmine some makeup, but they didn’t have what she needed. Then we went to Urban to see if they had the shirt Jasmine had wanted earlier in the week, but it was sold out again. After that, we checked GameStop for Pokémon cards (no luck) and then went to Miniso, where Jasmine found two Korean makeup items she liked and a pack of My Little Pony stickers. I bought all three for her.

We wandered the mall a couple more times, just talking and hanging out. Jasmine remembered that Noah, her brother, had taken her skincare stuff when he left for his NASA internship earlier that morning. So we went back to Sephora and I bought her a body wash. After that, she got hungry, so we went to Eddie V’s. The food was expensive, but we had such a good time. From joking about leaving after just eating the bread, to laughing at how my steak came out looking like just a clump of meat on a plate, it was all just… special. Jasmine kept offering to pay, but I kept refusing. I wanted this to be one last thing I did for her before I left.

After dinner, Jasmine wanted something sweet. We checked the Heytea line and it was too long. Then we checked the gelato place it was also packed. So we decided to stop by the bank before going to The Alley or Coco’s for a drink. At the ATM, I was surprised when Jasmine followed me. But then it clicked, she was just trying to spend every moment with me that she could. And once I realized that, it hit me how little time we had left. It was ticking away fast.

As we walked back to the car, Jasmine noticed some flowers near the ATM and jokingly said, “You never get me flowers.” She didn’t know it yet, but she’d see later.

We ended up getting drinks at Coco’s. After that, it was time to take her home. The car ride was quiet and heavy. It felt like we both knew it was ending, and neither of us wanted to admit it. We just sat in silence, trying to hold on to the moment.

Right before the turn to her house, she tried to lighten the mood. She said she was going to miss me so much, and she hoped the next 12 weeks would go by quickly. She said she couldn’t wait to come to California to see me.

When we got to her house, she said to wait because she had some things to give me. I told her to meet me in the parking lot because I had a little surprise for her too. She came back with a Jurassic Park Funko Pop and this cool little garage style key holder I had shown her months ago. I loved it. She remembered something small I said forever ago and that’s why I love her. She’s amazing.

When she walked up to my trunk to give me her gifts, I handed her a bouquet of flowers. “You said I never get you flowers, so here they are.” I had bought them earlier that day, just for this moment. I also let her pick one of the Squishmallows I had. She picked Clefairy and said she loved it.

I hugged her. She told me she was going to miss me so much and begged me not to forget her. I promised her I wouldn’t. I would miss her too. We hugged tighter. I kissed her.
And I didn’t say anything more, not because I didn’t have anything left to say, but because I knew if I did, I’d cry… and she would too.

As I drove away, I watched her walk back to her house, knowing that might be the last time I see her for a month… or maybe longer. I cried for most of the drive back. I had just left the girl I love, and I don’t know when I’ll see her again. I hope her summer isn’t too exciting without me (lol), but I know we’ll be okay. Long distance is hard, but we can do it.

I’m counting down the days until I see her again.
Until then goodbye, Jasmine.
I miss you so much.
And I’ll love you until the day I die.

Stay safe. Don’t forget about me.
We’ll see each other soon.
Until then…

With love,
Yevin ❤️</div>
